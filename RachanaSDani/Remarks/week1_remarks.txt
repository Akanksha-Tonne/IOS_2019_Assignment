Great Summary:
All the points are covered:
1.	Why kernels written within traditional data parallel programming model in not very effective over kernels written in warp-specialized manner.
2.	What is Barrier Synchronization.
3.	Brief of working of Warp-Specialized model with CUDA
4.	Producer Consumer Synchronization
Overall a very good attempt
